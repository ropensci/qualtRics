This project contains an R package to download surveys from  [Qualtrics](https://www.qualtrics.com/) using the API. 

Note that your institution must support API access and that it must be enabled for your account. Whoever manages your Qualtrics account can help you with this. Please refer to the [Qualtrics documentation](https://api.qualtrics.com/docs/authentication) to find your API token.

## Installation

To install this package, execute the following in R:

```r
install.packages("qualtRics")
```

Or, if you want to install the latest development version, run:

```r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("JasperHG90/qualtRics")
```

## Dependencies

All dependencies will be installed when you install `qualtRics`.

## Updates

Periodically check this repository for updates and execute `devtools::install_github("JasperHG90/qualtRics")` to update.

## Usage

Currently, the package contains three functions:

  1. *getSurveys()* fetches a list of all surveys that you own or have access to from Qualtrics.
  2. *getSurvey()* downloads a survey from Qualtrics and loads it into R.
  3. *readSurvey()* allows you to read CSV files you download manually from Qualtrics.

Note that you can only export surveys that you own, or to which you have been given explicit administration rights.

### Commands

Load the package:

```r
library(qualtRics)
```

Register your Qualtrics API key. You need to do this once every R session:

```r
registerApiKey(API.TOKEN = "<yourapitoken>")
```

Get a data frame of surveys:

```r
surveys <- getSurveys(root_url="https://leidenuniv.eu.qualtrics.com") # URL is for my own institution
```

Note that, while requests will work without a [root url](https://api.qualtrics.com/docs/root-url) for the `getSurveys` function, it is desirable that you supply it. Supplying the correct url will reduce the number of errors you'll experience. The `getSurvey` function requires you to pass this root url. Please refer to the [official documentation](https://api.qualtrics.com/docs/root-url) to find out your institution-specific root url.

Export a survey and load it into R:

```r
mysurvey <- getSurvey(surveyID = surveys$id[6], 
                      root_url = "https://leidenuniv.eu.qualtrics.com", 
                      verbose = TRUE)
```

You can add a from/to date to only retrieve responses between those dates:

```r
surv <- getSurvey(survs$id[4],
                  root_url = "https://leidenuniv.eu.qualtrics.com",
                  startDate = "2016-09-18",
                  endDate = "2016-10-01",
                  useLabels = FALSE,
                  verbose = TRUE)
```

You may also reference a response ID. `getSurvey` will then download all responses that were submitted after that response:

```r
surv <- getSurvey(survs$id[4],
                  root_url = "https://leidenuniv.eu.qualtrics.com",
                  lastResponseId = "R_3mmovCIeMllvsER",
                  useLabels = FALSE,
                  verbose = TRUE)
```

You can store the results in a specific location if you like:

```r
mysurvey <- getSurvey(surveyID = surveys$id[6], 
                      save_dir = "/users/jasper/desktop/", 
                      root_url = "https://leidenuniv.eu.qualtrics.com", 
                      verbose = TRUE)
```

Note that surveys that are stored in this way will be saved as an [RDS](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/readRDS.html) file rather than e.g. a CSV.

You can read a survey from a local file using `readSurvey`:

```r
mysurvey <- readSurvey("/users/jasper/desktop/mysurvey.csv")
```

To avoid special characters (mainly periods) in header names, `readSurvey` uses question labels as the header names. The question belonging to that label is then added using the [sjmisc](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sjmisc/index.html) package. Qualtrics gives names to these labels automatically, but you can easily change them.

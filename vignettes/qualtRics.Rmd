This project contains an R package to interact with the [Qualtrics API](https://www.qualtrics.com/). 

Note that your institution must support API access and that it must be enabled for your account. Whoever manages your Qualtrics account can help you with this. Please refer to the [Qualtrics documentation](https://api.qualtrics.com/docs/authentication) on how to find your API token. You'll also need your institution-specific [base url](https://api.qualtrics.com/docs/root-url).

## Installation

To install this package, execute the following in R:

```r
install.packages("qualtRics")
```

Or, if you want to install the latest development version, run:

```r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("JasperHG90/qualtRics")
```

## Usage

Currently, the package contains three functions. It supports fetching a list of courses and their IDs from qualtrics, as well as downloading and reading a survey export. 

Note that, while requests will work without a [base url](https://api.qualtrics.com/docs/root-url) for the `getSurveys` function, it is desirable that you supply it. Supplying the correct url will reduce the number of errors you'll experience. The `getSurvey` function requires you to pass this base url. Please refer to the [official documentation](https://api.qualtrics.com/docs/root-url) to find out your institution-specific base url.

Note that you can only export surveys that you own, or to which you have been given explicit administration rights.

### Commands

Load the package:

```r
library(qualtRics)
```

Construct the header information:

```r
head <- constructHeader(API.TOKEN = "<yourapitoken>")
```

Get a data frame of surveys:

```r
surveys <- getSurveys(head, survey_baseurl="https://leidenuniv.eu.qualtrics.com") # URL is for my own institution
```

Export a survey and load it into R:

```r
mysurvey <- getSurvey(surveyID = surveys$id[6], headers = head, base_url = "https://leidenuniv.eu.qualtrics.com", verbose = TRUE)
```

## Other information

For specific information about the Qualtrics API, you can refer to the [official documentation](https://api.qualtrics.com/docs/overview).
